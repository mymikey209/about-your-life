About your life
in this assinment we were asked to make a website about our interests and accomplishments we have made in our lives 
Peer Review: Max Mendoza- His code overall looks good. It is easy to read what code does what and its organized well. His website looks good too. He could have taken out the "Navbar" code and the "disabled" code just to make it that much more perfect. Maybe a little color to make the website pop a bit more but overall well done
